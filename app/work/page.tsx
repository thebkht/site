          passionate about building user-friendly interfaces and creating
          engaging digital experiences. Here are some of the places I've worked
          and the projects I've contributed to:

          Frontend Developer Intern, July 2024 â€” September 2024
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined Technocorp as a frontend developer intern. I collaborated on
          several front-end projects, contributing to UI/UX improvements, code
          optimization, and feature implementation, and worked on a small team
          building a new product from scratch. I've worked with technologies
          Nextjs (pages route), Tailwind CSS. And I've learned a lot about the
          software development process, from design to deployment. I've also
          gained experience working with a team and collaborating on projects.

          I built and maintain an open-source link shortener called
          bkhtdev/link. It's a simple and easy-to-use tool for creating and
          sharing short links. The project is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
          and Prisma, and is hosted on Vercel.

        <p>
          I've created an open-source blogging platform called FalseNotes. It's
          a simple and easy-to-use platform for writing and publishing blog
          posts. The project is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB. It
          features a clean and minimalistic design, a powerful editor, and a
          responsive layout. The platform is designed to be fast, secure, and
          user-friendly, with a focus on the writing experience.
