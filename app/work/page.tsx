          engaging digital experiences. Here are some of the places I've worked

          Frontend Developer Intern, July 2024 â€” September 2024
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined Technocorp as a frontend developer intern. I collaborated on
          several front-end projects, contributing to UI/UX improvements, code
          optimization, and feature implementation, and worked on a small team
          building a new product from scratch. I learned a lot about the product
          development process, from ideation to shipping. I also had the
          opportunity to work with a diverse team and learn from experienced and
          talented developers. I'm grateful for the experience and the
          opportunity to grow as a developer.
