Frontend developer skilled in projects ranging from simple sites to complex web apps, dedicated to crafting intuitive and engaging digital experiences. Here's where I've worked and what I've done:

## Experience

### Technocorp

<Small>Frontend Developer Intern, July 2024 â€” September 2024</Small>

I interned as a frontend developer, working on UI/UX enhancements, code optimization, and new product development using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, gaining insights from design to deployment.

## Projects

[bkhtdev/link](https://go.bkhtdev.com)

I built and maintain an open-source link shortener called bkhtdev/link. It's a simple and easy-to-use tool for creating and sharing short links. The project is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma, and is hosted on Vercel.

[FalseNotes](https://falsenotes.dev)

I've created an open-source blogging platform called FalseNotes. It's a simple and easy-to-use platform for writing and publishing blog posts. The project is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB. It features a clean and minimalistic design, a powerful editor, and a responsive layout. The platform is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly, with a focus on the writing experience.
